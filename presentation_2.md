# Tuple

an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements.

---

# Tuple

an <span class='marker'>immutable</span>, or unchangeable, <span class='marker'>ordered sequence</span> of elements.

--
Who can spot the difference from a list?
---

# Tuple
** Immutability changes everything **

```python
record = ('alon','nisser', 45)
record[0]
'alon'
record.append('aa')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'

```

---

# Sets

--
Bonus - can we implement sets with the data structures we already know?

--

```python

```
---
# Stack

LIFO logic - last in first out

```python
lyrics = ['Our','house','in','the','middle','of','the']
lyrics.append('street')
next_word = lyrics.pop()
print(next_word)
next_word = lyrics.pop()
print(next_word)
```
---
# Queues

FIFO logic - first in first out
